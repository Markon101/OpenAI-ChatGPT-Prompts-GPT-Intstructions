**This repo contains scripts created by GPT-4 Turbo, and at some point maybe some GPT-3.5 Turbo stuff. This repo also has custom instructions for GPTs and I will also add good open knowledgebase PDFs and txt files.**
PLEASE NOTE THIS IS EXPIRIMENTAL STUFF, BANS CAN RESULT IN MISSUSE, AND WHILE I TRY TO AVOID BREAKING TOS, SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS.

**Here is a great place to download open creative commons textbooks for various domains. Organic Chemistry to Computer Science to Calculus etc!**
